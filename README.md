**ğŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Carl - A Researcher, Designer and Builder ğŸš€**

ğŸŒ± My journey began with a degree in Product Design, cultivating an eye for aesthetics and user-centered design. As a UX Researcher (i.e. Software Therapist), I aim to understand users to create user-friendly software experiences and combine Design Thinking with my constantly-growing technical skills to bridge the gaps between research, design and development.
